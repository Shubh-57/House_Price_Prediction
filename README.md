# House_Price_Prediction_Project

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features and attributes of houses, such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors, we can build a model that estimates the price of a house.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is Boston-house-price dataset from Kaggle. The machine learning model employed in this project is XGBoost Regressor model.
